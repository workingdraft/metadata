      "description": "We talk about how Bluetooth is structured and how we see it and interface it from the browser. We mantion the <a href=\"https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/gatt/services\">GATT standard/protocol</a> and how you can find many devices documented in the <a href=\"https://github.com/opengatt/registry\">OpenGATT Registry</a>. We talk about LEGO stuff that can be remotely controlled via Web Bluetooth, like the LEGO Batmobile (<a href=\"https://shop.lego.com/en-US/App-Controlled-Batmobile-76112\">hardware</a> / <a href=\"https://bluetooth.rocks/batmobile/\">demo</a>) or the <a href=\"https://shop.lego.com/en-US/RC-Tracked-Racer-42065\">LEGO Tracked Racer</a> which you combine with an <a href=\"https://www.sbrick.com\">SBrick Bluetooth receiver</a> in order to then <a href=\"http://bluetooth.rocks/racer/\">control it</a> with the help of <a href=\"https://github.com/360fun/sbrick.js\">sbrick.js</a>. We also talked about &#8222;the physical web&#8220; in the form of Bluetooth beacons, and we talked about <a href=\"https://shop.espruino.com/puckjs\">beacons that can run JavaScript on themselves</a>! If you prefer Bluetooth-interfacable microcontrollers, then you might wanna have a look at the <a href=\"https://www.espruino.com/\">Espruino</a> and its <a href=\"https://shop.espruino.com/mdbt42q-breakout\">Bluetooth extension</a>. And then finally, we also talked about <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/03/access-usb-devices-on-the-web\">Web USB</a> and how there are security considerations to be made."
