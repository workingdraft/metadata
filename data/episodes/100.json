Almost 2 years of weekly updates and discussions on web development &#8211; and we&#8217;re still here. And so no one less than <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paul_irish\">Paul Irish</a> joined Hans, Kahlil, Rodney and Schepp. While our podcast is a German thing, we&#8217;re thrilled how things turned out with recording an English episode over the wire. Thank you Paul!",

BountySource let&#8217;s you define an amount (say 15$) up for grabs to anyone willing to solve your issue with an open source project. All you need to participate is a GitHub account and either PayPal or Google Wallet. Finally something that might work smoothly in Europe as well.

They will not enhance how we work, they will (evenutally) change the way we create web apps. Flexbox (and the other layouting schemes) are missing from the list. We&#8217;re still eagerly awaiting their availability. The <a href=\"http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Autocomplete_Types\">Autocomplete API</a> (spec in development) is something that will benefit users more than developers. That and Mozilla&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/persona/\">Persona</a> will hopefully put an end to all that identification and recurring data input mess that has been our internet."
