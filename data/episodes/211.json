He explains how it came to fruition, and how Microsoft will behave with not having Apple on board. While the Working Draft crew is strongly ranting about Apple&#8217;s broken <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/touch-events/#the-touchstart-event\">Touch API</a>, Jacob calls Safari developers &#8220;nice guys&#8221; and tells how it came to reverse engineering the standard by the W3C and the implementation in Windows Phone."
