# Workingdraft Metadata Repository

This repository provides metadata for the German [Workingdraft](http://workingdraft.de/) podcast episodes.

The data in `episodes.json` is (mostly) maintained manually, thus might not always contain the latest episodes. The data in `contents.json` is aggregated through web-scraping the wordpress of Workingdraft (see `bin/update.js`).
